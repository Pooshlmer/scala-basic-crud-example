This is a generic CRUD application that uses a PostgreSQL database.
I tried documenting through the comments what I had to go through
while learning, so hopefully it will be useful to people. A lot of
the documentation on the website is outdated or just difficult to
grasp if you aren't that familiar with Scala.

If you want to run this, first install the play framework (I used
the latest typesafe activator) and then run calendar.sql in two
databases named calendar and calendar-test. If you want to change
the names/database, you will have to edit conf/application.conf and
test/util/ExternalDBApp.scala. There's only 4 small tables currently
so you can look over the sql file if necessary.

Feel free to contact me with any questions/suggestions/corrections/etc.
